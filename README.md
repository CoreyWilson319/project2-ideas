# Project 2 Planning

Fork & Clone this repo.

## Part 1

Review the [Project 2 requirements](https://romebell.gitbook.io/sei-1019/projects/project-2) and check out some [examples](https://tmdarneille.gitbook.io/seirfx/11-projects/past-projects/project2).

In this space below, list **THREE** ideas for your Project 2. For each idea, include [user stories](https://revelry.co/user-stories-that-dont-suck/) for each idea and a link to the API(s) you want to use for it.

--------------------------------------------------------
1. Store some sort of information about the user like location and pull local news for that location. Need to find a large scale news media outlet api that also has news depending on location.
2. Pokemon Go app that lets the user search how to encounter certain types of pokemon and maybe information about that pokemon. Maybe have it so that the user can save the results for later using the pokemon go api.
3. Use the steam api for news feeds for steam games, and maybe a way to watch for sales.
